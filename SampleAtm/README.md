## Getting Started

Welcome to a simple sample project by me

In this project we assume we have a MYSQL database that takes in an account number, an account name, balance, and a pin.

The program should run fine as long as you connect to a database and you change the filepath of the jdbc driver depending on where it is located at, as well as updating the username and password to whatever yours is.

I hope this project is able to demonstrate a good understanding on java, as well as a want to continue learning. 

There are still many things that can be fixed and made better in this project
